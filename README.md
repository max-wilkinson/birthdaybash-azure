# Birthday Bash

Birthday bash is a Slackbot powered by an Azure serverless function that wishes people a happy birthday on their special day.

## Background

Our team was in a need for a centralized repository of birthdays, as well as a mechanism for announcing birthdays. Creating a serverless Slackbot serves this need in a reliable and cost-effective manner. This codebase was created to be easily adapted for any group of people. To personalize Birthday Bash for your team, simply add your birthday's to the `birthdayCollection.ts` file.

## Requirements

Debugging and deploying the function works best in VS Code with the Azure Functions extension. You will also need to provide a Slack webhook URL in your environment variables.

## Release Notes

We are hard at work creating the best experience possible for Birthday Bash. If you have any feedback feel free to submit an issue to this repository.
